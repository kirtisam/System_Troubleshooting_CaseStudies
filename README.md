Windows Microphone Issue â€“ Resolved Through Self-Troubleshooting and Privacy Setting Audit
Project Description:
After a fresh installation of Windows OS, the internal microphone on my device suddenly stopped working. Several technicians diagnosed the issue incorrectly, suggesting expensive OS version changes or even hardware replacement.

Instead of blindly following those recommendations, I chose to investigate the problem independently. Upon a careful review of Windows Privacy Settings, I discovered that microphone access was disabled for apps and system functionsâ€”a simple but often overlooked setting.

**ðŸ§  Key Learnings:**
Sometimes, the issue lies in settings, not software or hardware.

Gained confidence in basic Windows OS troubleshooting.
Reinforced the importance of critical thinking and not jumping to conclusions.
Highlighted how self-learning can save both time and money.

**ðŸ’¡ Outcome:**
The issue was resolved without any external help, software downgrade, or hardware changesâ€”just a few privacy setting adjustments. This experience significantly improved my confidence in system-level troubleshooting.
